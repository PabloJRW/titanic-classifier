# titanic-classifier

This project focuses on performing an exploratory data analysis of the Titanic dataset, with the goal of identifying the best predictor variables 
that could be used to create accurate machine learning models. 
The statistical analysis in this project includes hypothesis tests such as: 
* Shapiro-Wilk test, 
* t-test
* chi2 test
* Cramer's V. 
* Kruskal-Wallis

By identifying these variables, we can create more accurate models that can predict which passengers are more likely to 
survive the accident. Ultimately, this project aims to provide insights into the factors that influenced the survival rate on the Titanic and to develop 
models that can accurately predict who survived and who did not.
